MY GAME IDEA/Pitch

1. It is a 2d game where you are skateboarding throughout the map, trying to collects coins, while you are going through obstacles trying not to fall
off your skateboard. It will be a scrolling world technique type of game, where you are constantly moving right until the end of the map/game. (You will also have 3 lives per level.

2. It is a 2d game. you will be playing a male skateboarder named 

3. The character will be able to jump, do skateboard tricks, go faster, and duck. The characters goal is to finish the level with dying by hitting
unecessary obstacles.

4. You win by completing the levels. There will be 3 big stars that if you collect every level you get a higher score.

5. You complete a level by reaching the end without dying. This is also how you advanced to the next.

6. Sources of inspiration: I got some inspiration from Mario, Sonic and tony hawks pro skater.

7. I am mainly just looking for a teammate that is good in working in groups and that cooperates.
